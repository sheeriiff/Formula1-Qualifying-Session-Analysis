# Formula1-Qualifying-Session-Analysis
Build a project that compares the qualifying lap times of the F1 teams in the first quarters of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Show how the drivers and cars perform year over year under the new regulations.
The races included in this analysis are: 

• 🇧🇭 Bahrain GP (Bahrain International Circuit)
• 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabian GP (Jeddah Corniche Circuit)
• 🇦🇺 Australian GP (Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit)
• 🇯🇵 Japanese GP (Suzuka Circuit)
• 🇨🇳 Chinese GP (Shanghai International Circuit)
• 🇺🇸 Miami GP (Miami International Autodrome) 

📊 I manually collected lap time data, cleaned it using Pandas, handled cases like "NO TIME" laps, and visualized the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

💡 Key Insights from the Project: 

🥇 Shift in Pole Dominance
• In 2024, Max Verstappen dominated the qualifying sessions with multiple pole positions.
• In 2025, McLaren (Norris & Piastri) showed major improvement, securing multiple poles and staying within 0.050s of Verstappen in several races. 

⏱️ Lap Time Evolution
• Most drivers improved their lap times in 2025, with pole laps up to 3 seconds faster at some tracks.
• The largest year-over-year pole improvement occurred in Shanghai, where Piastri was 3.019s faster than Verstappen’s 2024 pole.
• Hamilton and Albon showed over 3 seconds of year-over-year improvement, especially in Shanghai and Jeddah.
• Verstappen remained a strong qualifier, but in 2025, his dominance narrowed, with smaller gaps to the top 5 and more pressure from rivals. 

👥 Teammate Battles Were Fascinating
• In Mercedes, Antonelli began outperforming Russell by mid-season 2025, showing his adaptation to the car.
• In McLaren, Norris consistently outpaced Piastri in early 2024, but by 2025, they were often separated by less than 0.050s, a sign of rising internal competition and Piastri’s growth. 

🚀 Most Improved Drivers (YoY)
• Lewis Hamilton: Improved by up to 0.987s in some races.
• Alex Albon: Over 3.5s faster than his 2024 qualifying time in one race, likely due to car upgrades.
• Leclerc: Small but steady improvements that kept Ferrari competitive.
